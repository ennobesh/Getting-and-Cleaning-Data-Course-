This project contains:
#1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#Reading files
#Reading feature vector
#Reading activity labels
#Assigning column names
#Merging all data in one set

#2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
#Reading column names:
#Create vector for ID, mean and standard deviation
#Making subset from set_mean_std:

#3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

#4. Appropriately labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.

#5. From the data set in Step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
#Making a second tidy dataset
#Writing second tidy data set in txt file
